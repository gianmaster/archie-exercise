This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

## Stack
This exercise is mostly written with Typescript and the below tools:
- GraphQl
- Next.js
- React.js
- Apollo client
- Graphql generator (to generate all the types in `.ts`) `yarn codegen`
- Chakra (PoC)

## Requirement
About this app:
- Should a be NextJs project
- Using create-next-app is fine
- Should use typescript
- Use [SpaceXâ€™s graphql api](https://api.spacex.land/graphql/) to query the data required to build the exercise

## How this works

Here is a demo (deployed with vercel)
